# sql4ml
This project aims to bridge the gap between SQL and machine learning by developing a system that translates SQL queries directly into TensorFlow operations. The solution addresses the challenge many professionals face when transitioning from traditional database management to machine learning frameworks, as it eliminates the need for advanced programming skills. Built using Django, the system allows users to define machine learning objectives through familiar SQL syntax, which is then automatically converted into executable TensorFlow code. The platform supports common models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and SVM, while handling data through MySQL and Pandas. By automating the conversion process and providing a user-friendly interface, the system makes advanced analytics more accessible to SQL users while maintaining TensorFlow's robust capabilities.
