# sql4ml
A system that bridges SQL and machine learning by translating SQL queries into TensorFlow operations. Built with Django, it converts SQL syntax to executable machine learning code, supporting models like Linear/Logistic Regression and SVM. This makes advanced analytics accessible to SQL users without requiring advanced programming skills.
